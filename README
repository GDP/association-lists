AdminLists
==========

I'm resurrecting this plugin I started extracting from http://www.democracynow.org along time ago.
It may not even work in rails 2, but I'm hoping to get it working alongside attribute_fu for a light
weight solution to admin forms...

This plugin will create pretty lists of records for your admin area.
It will automatically create buttons for certain toggle-able fields (eg published, featured) 
if your model has them, and will add drag and drop ordering for any records 
that act_as_list.

It requires restful routing, admin name-spaced controllers, and 
various other configurations, so it is not for public consumption at this point.

There are 2 other parts to this that have not been extracted yet.
admin_association_list will create admin lists for model associations, 
so you can have a form for your primary model, and inside of that a list
with it's associations. It allows you to edit associations in place, and
dynamically add more. There are also rjs helpers for updating the list,
on edit, update and destroy.

Installation
============
./script/generate admin_lists

Example
=======
